Clone live site to the local site and vice versa.

== Description ==

Local Sync allows you to clone live site to the local site and live site to the local site, in the click of a button.<br>
The local site can even be setup on your local computer.<br>
The cloning process will be very fast, since it transfers only the files that are different.<br>
