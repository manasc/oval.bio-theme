                <p>The NASA Apollo program is our role model. Most people associate the Apollo program with the Apollo 11 mission, which landed the first humans on the moon, and brought them back safely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Apollo program had the following goals:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Establishing the technology to meet other national interests in space.</li>
                    <li>Achieving preeminence in space for the United States.</li>
                    <li>Carrying out a program of scientific exploration of the Moon.</li>
                    <li>Developing human capability to work in the lunar environment.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>At oval.bio, we want people to associate life extension pods with us. We’ll achieve that through the following company initiatives:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create and utilize technologies which can have an impact on functionally extending the human lifespan.</li>
                    <li>Give transparent access to these technologies to as many humans as possible.</li>
                    <li>Test and quantify efficacy recognizing that not all people respond the same to the same technology.</li>
                    <li>Stay true to the mission.</li>

                <p>Just as NASA used the mission of getting humans to the moon and returning them as their core, we have our mission. NASA used the Saturn rockets as the main vehicle to achieve that, our rocket equivalent is the pod.</p>

Each one of these pillars covers a piece of the puzzle to position oneself for attaining life extension. Some of them are more abstract or less well defined in importance, such as lifestyle (how much exercise or sex, size or defined quality of positive social circle).

                    POD more than just for oval.bio
                    We’re breaking preconceived notions of what capitalism and free market economics are in the pursuit of providing extensive, ultra-transparent access to functional life extension technology. In other words, we are creating an industry and being at the forefront goes hand-in-hand with defining the category*. The pod is just the beginning in two very import ways:

                    <ol>
                        <li>Our research and technology used for the pod can be and will be used for future products, similar to how NASA’s Apollo mission lead many modern technologies spanning multiple industries.</li>
                        <li>The pod will produce millions of anonymous health-related datapoints. These points can be used for research by university and health research organizations around the world. We will be collaborating with many organizations to process this data and, as a community, develop life-extension therapies.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex-none bg-ovalGreen">
                <p>The pod, however, can be useful for much more than how we had initially envisioned it. This is essentially a human biosensor interface. What this means is that facilities can use our pods to measure the response of patients to other therapies and treatments, or as a way to measure them when they are submitted for review.
