                            The NASA Apollo program is our role model. Most people associate the
                            Apollo program with the Apollo 11 mission, which landed the first humans
                            on the moon, and brought them back safely.

                            At oval.bio, we want people to associate life extension pods with us.
                            Weâ€™ll achieve that through the following company initiatives:

                                functionally extending the human lifespan.

                            Just as NASA used the mission of getting humans to the moon and
                            returning them as their core, we have our mission. NASA used the Saturn
                            rockets as the main vehicle to achieve that, our rocket equivalent is
                            the pod.
