            Shares are split into 2 groups (all exactly the same), 1 group of 50% of the shares (500,000,000) is controlled by
            Michael Kiamanesh and the board, to be called the internal shares. The other equal group of 500,000,000 shares is
            distributed to buyers oval.bio products and services to be the external shares.
        </p>
        <p class="wp-block">Shares are only given away by oval.bio and do not carry any value.</p>
        <p class="wp-block">
            Internal shares are meant to be given to workers and contributors. External shares are given to anyone who buys
            product, however no individual or entity can either directly or indirectly control more than 1% of these shares.
            Likewise no individual or entity who holds greater than 1% of internal shares can have any of the external shares.
        </p>

            Attempts to by-pass this will result in share forfeiture of those excess shares and can be put to a vote by the rest
            of the shareholders if the remainder of the individuals shares should be taken away.
        </p>

        <p class="wp-block">
            There will not be any more shares created until all of the first 1 billion are handed out. There will be a vote by
            existing shareholders within 30 days after the last share is given out but not sooner than 10 days. This delay is
            intentional to allow a discussion and analysis of the situation at that time to be done. Michael Kiamanesh will
            always be limited to a maximum 25% of outstanding shares, he will start with 250,000,000 shares. Utilization of
            distributed ledger for keeping track of shares.

            In the beginning because of capital restrictions we give external shares as points through our website, the amount
            of points given is dependent on the direct product cost (does not include shipping or taxes or other fees) and at
            what phase we are at (points per dollar diminish as the company grows via sales revenue). All must understand and
            agree that any points or rewards attained during this time are not transferable and do not provide any voting
            ability until we have setup our cryptoshares network. Once this is completed all points and/or rewards will be
            transitioned to this setup and the holders will then be given the opportunity to transfer the shares to any other
            account on the network and to also use each share for one vote. The transition to the cryptoshares will start once
            we achieve $500k in sales.

            Oval.bio follows what it calls â€“ Rising Tide IP policy. This is a give and take policy where all of our IP except
            brand names, are freely available for others to use anyway they want with no expectation of royalties or
            remuneration. However there are two requirements as part of this.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>User must give oval.bio reasonable recognition no small than 33% in size or visibility as its own name.</li>
            <li>
                User understands that in turn oval.bio can utilize any of their IP except brand names, as long as they give the
                same due recognition to them.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Trying to bypass this give take policy by using different names and shell companies will be seen as a greedy under
            handed scumbag sleight and oval.bio will use any means necessary to find justice. Our mission we want to better the
            situation of all of humanity, greediness is counter to that, perhaps as the top contributing factor to civilizations
            ills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the rising tide policy the free access of IP is meant to let everyone benefit from each others innovations
            to allow betterment of all in the pursuit of the core goal of creating access to life extension technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is any IP that we have not sufficiently given access to, including videos, images or other media as well as
            the more obvious technological information please message us so we can resolve this together.

            Many companies take your data and sell it to others with your identifiable information attached. We do not want to know your name, we will not ask for your name when signing up to use a pod, instead we will have you utilize a username which will give you access.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do however want as much about you demographical and lifestyle and biological information as we can get. Reason are so that we can internally use this data to get a more full picture of how certain demographics respond and if there are correlations, as well as provide users data on how they compare to others with similar data or demographic information. We will additionally release large group data with identifiable information scrubbed so that researchers around the world can analyze the data and help find benefit for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            User privacy is of major importance to us, maybe even more important than to many users. We will never sell your information and will continually expend resources to further encrypt and anonymize all data gathered, so society can benefit from it but users privacies are kept 100% secure.
            One of our earliest milestone goals is to transition the website so all sales have names of buyers encrypted and untracked instead it will be driven by their account number.
        </p>
        <p>
            An additional early step we will be taking is for the Face and 3D scanner data to be kept separate from the rest of the analytical data so as to provide an additional level of security to prevent identifying a user.
